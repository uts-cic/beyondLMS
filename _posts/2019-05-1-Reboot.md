Right - I have finally found some time to breathe, which means I have managed to update the beyondLMS website! This is good, as you might have noticed that the old one broke at some point, and was getting a bit old anyway.

In the next period I am going to be working quite a bit more on [data portability]({{site.baseurl}}/dataPortability/) and the [LA-API]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/LA-API/). Things are really starting to ramp up here. Stay tuned!

Let's see if I can get this blog up and running again...
