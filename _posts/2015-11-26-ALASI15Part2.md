This blog post is the second of two aimed at people attending [ALASI 2015](https://www.itl.usyd.edu.au/analytics/alasi.htm). Check out the [first post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-11-18-ALASI15Part1 %}), which has some pre-workshop preparation, and most importantly <b>gives you some instructions about how to create an account in the CLA toolkit.

If you are interested in participating in the workshop from beyond ALASI'15 then you are welcome, follow the specific instructions below.

### ALASI workshop - Stages and basic lesson plan

The workshop will cover the following topics in a series of mini-workshops. Each subsection will build upon what has gone before, but if you miss the first session, you should still be able to walk in to the second one (it will be easier to do this if you complete the preparation phase in [stage one]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-11-18-ALASI15Part1 %}) first. Topics will be discussed in the following loose order:

1. Introduction to project, data generation and sign up to CLA toolkit (Kirsty Kitto)
1. Social Network and Content Analysis (Aneesha Bakharia & Shane Dawson)
1. Feedback Loops (Abelardo Pardo)
1. **Break**
1. Discourse Analytics (Andrew Gibson & Simon Buckingham Shum)
1. Nature of Interaction (Community of Inquiry and Cognitive Presence) (Dragan Gasevic & Kirsty Kitto)
