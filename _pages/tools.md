We are developing a number of tools for using LA beyond the LMS.  Some of the tools have been developed using funding obtained by the Australian Government, some with support from Graduate Careers Australia, and others using various internal funds.  The following  pages will give you specific information about each tool and the project that it emerged from. 

- The [Connected Learning Analytics (CLA) toolkit]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/CLAtoolkit/)
- The [Learning Analytics API (LA-API)]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/LA-API/)
- The Graduate Employability Toolkit
