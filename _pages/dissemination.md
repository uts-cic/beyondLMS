Beyond this site, there are many ways in which we have worked to disseminate the outcomes of various projects that come under this BeyondLMS banner.

### Final Report!

This work was started under an Australian Government funded grant (in one of the final rounds for the now disbanded Office of Learning and Teaching, OLT). ID14-3821: Learning Analytics beyond the LMS: Enabling Connected Learning via Open Source Analytics in “the wild”

Want to find out more? You can read the [final report]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/papers/OLTFinalReport.pdf) for this project, or download the [achievements statement]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/papers/OLTAchievementsStatement-Final.pdf), or [executive summary]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/papers/OLTFinalReport-execSummary.pdf).

### Peer Reviewed Publications

You could  check out our repository of refereed [Formal Publications]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/) which has all the papers associated with projects that this site covers.

###  Blogs

Or... if you want something a bit less formal then you could head to the [blog associated with this site]({{site.baseurl}}/posts), some of the other guest blogs that we have contributed to at various points in time:
- [LACE: Towards a manifesto for data ownership](http://www.laceproject.eu/blog/towards-a-manifesto-for-data-ownership/)
- [xAPI quarterly: Why do we need interoperability anyway?](https://xapiquarterly.com/2017/06/need-interoperability-anyway/)

### Work with standards bodies

Much of the work completed by the beyondLMS team has fed into the creation of reports and standards development. Why not go and check a couple of them out?

- [LACE Project, Workpackage D7.4 Learning Analytics Interoperability: Requirements, Specifications and Adoption](http://www.laceproject.eu/deliverables/d7-4-learning-analytics-interoperability-requirements-specifications-and-adoption/)
- [ISO/IEC JTC 001/SC 36/WG 08 "Learning Analytics Interoperability" Functions](https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=16949929&objAction=browse&viewType=1)
